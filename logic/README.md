# Logic Assessment

* This assessment is required for all applicants.
* All methods/functions should have tests.
* We have provided one example test. You may write your tests in the same manner, or use your own preferred libraries/tools.
* You may use any tools/libraries/frameworks you are comfortable with.
* In the Frontend/Backend assessments feel free to use any resources you like to complete the challenges. In this **logic assessment**, limit yourself to your own knowledge and, if needed, the MDN JavaScript documentation.
* Open `challenge1.js` in your text editor/IDE and follow its instructions.
